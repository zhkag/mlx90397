## Instructions for use

### Dependence

- RT-Thread 4.0.0+
- Sensor component
- IIC/SPI driver: mlx90397 devices use IIC/SPI for data communication, and need system IIC/SPI driver support;

### Get the package

To use the mlx90397 software package, you need to select it in the RT-Thread package management. The specific path is as follows:

```
RT-Thread online packages  --->
  peripheral libraries and drivers  --->
    sensors drivers  --->
      mlx90397: Universal 3-axis sensor driver package,support: magnetometer.
              Version (latest)  --->
        [*]   Enable mlx90397 mag
```

**Enable mlx90397 mag**: Configure to turn on the Magnetometer function

**Version**: software package version selection

### Using packages

The initialization function of mlx90397 software package is as follows:

```
int rt_hw_mlx9039x_init(const char *name, struct rt_sensor_config *cfg);
```

This function needs to be called by the user. The main functions of the function are:

- Device configuration and initialization (configure interface devices and interrupt pins according to the incoming configuration information);
- Register the corresponding sensor device and complete the registration of the mlx90397 device;

#### Initialization example

```
#include "sensor_melexis_mlx9039x.h"

int rt_hw_mlx9039x_port(void)
{
    struct rt_sensor_config cfg;
    
    cfg.intf.dev_name = "i2c1";
    cfg.intf.user_data = (void *)MLX9039x_ADDR_DEFAULT;
    cfg.irq_pin.pin = RT_PIN_NONE;

    rt_hw_mlx9039x_init("mlx", &cfg);
    return 0;
}
INIT_APP_EXPORT(rt_hw_mlx9039x_port);
```
